Pothole Fixit App is an Android Application which is used for detecting of potholes and reporting of them to the concerned authority.In this app the user clicks the picture of Pothole in there area and our app detects whether pothole is present in the picture or not.If it is present then user is advanced to the complaint registration where the pothole location is automatically taken from the place where picture was clicked.Now this pothole complaint is forwarded to the PWD department and then the neccessary action is taken from the PWD workers.
